# Deep-Learning-Project
Self Driving Car 
- The simulator, written in Unity, allows you to drive a car around a track and record a video of the front view of the ride as well as the input commands
- trained the deep neural network(CNN) on the collected data (the images + the input commands)
- the model created predicts the angle for the image provided
- the car needs to be steered at this angle to be on the road
- Tested this model in Udacity's open-source simulator and the car completed more than 10 rounds of the track without going off the road and without colliding with the obstacle
